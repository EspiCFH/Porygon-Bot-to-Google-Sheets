# Porygon-Bot-to-Google-Sheets
Porygon is a discord bot you can download that analyses Pokémon Showdown!™ replays and gives information about kills and deaths for each pokemon. 
This program is designed to take that output and let you paste it into a google sheets format.
This program is useful in instances where getting these stats from battles is important, like a draft league.

# How to Use
The first thing you should do is open format.txt and edit it to fit the format of whichever output you need. Make sure that you use the exact same wording and capitalization as the example given here. Spelling errors will cause the output to not have all the correct data.

Once you start the program, copy the message from Porygon on discord and paste it in. Then you should press enter to run the program.
You will find the result in Output.txt in the same directory as the .exe/.py
